Medical errors can have disastrous effects, they can be emotionally and physically harmful. In some extreme cases, they can be fatal. The objective of this project is to supply physicians
with a tool that may assist them in the diagnosis of certain diseases. I believe this can be
achieved with the utilisation of machine learning algorithms.

This application software is designed to be used by doctors in order to highlight important
results from a standard check-up. This way, the doctor can be presented with a compiled list of possible diseases that may need to be tested for in that patient. In addition, the
information may be separately presented in a non-technical, illustrative manner so that the application may also be used to inform the patient as to how they might improve their health.

The basic premise of this project is to utilise a select few basic blood tests. For example, a test measuring the patientâ€™s blood count, cholesterol level, uric acid, blood-glucose levels etc.
These tests are often done as part of a standard check-up. However, what makes these tests
particularly interesting for this project is that they can all be performed without the need of a
laboratory, they only require a single drop of blood for each test and they tell a tremendous
amount about the human body.
